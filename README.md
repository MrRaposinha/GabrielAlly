## 🌟 Features

- **Gabriel as an Ally**:
  - When a wave of enemies spawns, Gabriel appears at your position to assist in combat, attacking any enemy in his sight.
  - Once the wave is cleared, Gabriel despawns until the next wave.
  - If the player dies during the wave, Gabriel will despawn automatically.

- **Loyal and Unstoppable**:
  - Gabriel is **100% loyal** to the player, ignoring the player completely and focusing solely on enemies.
  - As an **immortal entity** (Blessed), Gabriel is unaffected by damage from enemies or the player.

- **Unchanged Boss Fights**:
  - Gabriel will not spawn to assist during boss battles, preserving the intensity of these encounters.

   - Gabriel’s attacks can still harm the player if caught in the crossfire, so stay alert during combat.
   
2. **No Boss Assistance**:
